About 
    Crusty Bucket is a fast-food restaurant designed to bring the fresh flavors and culture of Bikini Bottom to our world above. Just like in Bikini Bottom, it is most popularly known for its signature dish, the Krabby Patty, which is made using a secret formula that Mr.Krabs has carefully guarded. It should be noted, however, that the Crusty Bucket also features a selection of menu items that represent not only the beloved Krusty Krab but also its main competitor, the Chum Bucket. With it, the dishes from the two restaurants were brought together in this one area to showcase Bikini Bottom's diverse palate. Along with the menu, additional package meals, supercards, delivery services, and book reservations are also offered. These of which can be accessed with a simple log-in to our website.
